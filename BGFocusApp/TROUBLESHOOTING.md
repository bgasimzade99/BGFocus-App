## 🔧 **WorkletsError Resolution**

### **Issue Identified**
- **Error**: `WorkletsError: Mismatch between JavaScript part and native part of Worklets (0.6.0 vs 0.5.1)`

- **Impact**: App crashes on startup with red error screen

### **Professional Resolution Applied**

#### ✅ **Step 1: Version Alignment**
```bash
# Removed incompatible version
npm uninstall react-native-reanimated

# Installed Expo SDK 54 compatible version
npm install react-native-reanimated@~4.1.1
```

#### ✅ **Step 2: Configuration Update**
Updated `babel.config.js` to properly include Reanimated plugin:
```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  };
};
```

#### ✅ **Step 3: Cache Clear**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```
